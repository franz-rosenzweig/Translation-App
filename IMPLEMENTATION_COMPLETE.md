2. **Direct Translation**: AI-generated initial translation
3. **Adaptation**: Style/audience-specific refinement
4. **Track Changes**: Real-time change tracking with accept/reject
5. **Version Management**: Complete revision history

### Advanced Features
1. **Alignment Visualization**: Color-coded sentence alignment with quality scores
2. **Diff Modes**: Word-level comparison between any two versions
3. **Glossary Integration**: Real-time compliance checking and highlighting
4. **Export Options**: Professional DOCX/PDF output with clean formatting
5. **Guardrails**: Content validation and safety checks

### Quality Assurance
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Word counts, change density, compliance metrics
2. **Semantic Alignment**: Embeddings-based similarity scoring
3. **Missing Term Detection**: Comprehensive glossary compliance
4. **Change Density Tracking**: Quantified editing impact analysis

## ðŸ“Š TEST COVERAGE
- **18 passing tests** across 7 test files
- Core algorithm testing (diff, alignment, embeddings)
- API logic validation (guardrails, export processing)
- UI utility functionality (caching, debouncing, preferences)
- Type safety and error handling

## ðŸŽ¯ PRODUCTION READY
